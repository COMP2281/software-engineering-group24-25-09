# Creating a new slide

## Basic slide properties

Once you have found the engagement that you wish to create a slide from, you can now create a slide:

<img title="" src="images\newslide_2.png" alt="" width="640">[Needs to be updated]

From this menu, you can edit many properties of the slide:

- Title and academic institution
  
  - By default, these are AI generated from the source engagement.
  
  - You can either use the AI generated results, or you can modify them.

- Summary
  
  - By default, this is also AI generated.
  
  - However, you can augment the AI generated summary, or replace it entirely.

- Images
  
  - You can currently choose only one image using the radio buttons.
  
  - In the future, we may increase the number of images that you can add, and allow uploading of your own images.

- Personnel mentioned
  
  - The program by default shows the three persons that were most frequently mentioned in the past few slides.
  
  - However, you can list additional personnel. Just type the names of the persons mentioned, separating each person using a comma.
