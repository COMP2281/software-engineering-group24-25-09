# Selecting a slide

## Start creating a new slide

The Academic Engagement Tracker program is designed to allow you to create slideshows about academic engagements using AI. By pressing the "+ New Slide" button on the top right of the main menu user interface, you are taken to this screen: 

<img title="" src="images\newslide_1.png" alt="" width="640">[Will display a list of different academic engagements in the future]

You can either click on an existing academic engagement, search for a specific engagement title or date, or you can scrape for new engagements using the built in web scraper function.

If the program cannot find an engagement, then it will suggest alternatives to the engagement that may be relevant.

## Scraping engagements

To scrape engagements, click "Scrape Engagements". Once the web scraper has run, new engagements will appear.

We suggest running this every time you start the program, but no more than once per day. This is to ensure that you do not use too many API credits for the Google Search API that the web scraper uses.
