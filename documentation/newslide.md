# Creating a new slide

## Start creating a new slide

The Academic Engagement Tracker program is designed to allow you to create slideshows about academic engagements using AI. By pressing the "+ New Slide" button on the top right of the main menu user interface, you are taken to this screen: 

<img title="" src="images\newslide_1.png" alt="" width="640">[Will display a list of different academic engagements in the future]

You can either click on an existing academic engagement, search for a specific engagement title or date, or you can scrape for new engagements using the built in web scraper function.

If the program cannot find an engagement, then it will suggest alternatives to the engagement that may be relevant.

## Basic slide properties

Once you have found the engagement that you wish to create a slide from, you can now create a slide:

<img title="" src="images\newslide_2.png" alt="" width="640">[Needs to be updated]

From this menu, you can edit many properties of the slide:

- Title and academic institution
  
  - By default, these are AI generated from the source engagement.
  
  - You can either use the AI generated results, or you can modify them.

- Summary
  
  - By default, this is also AI generated.
  
  - However, you can augment the AI generated summary, or replace it entirely.

- Images
  
  - You can currently choose only one image using the radio buttons.
  
  - In the future, we may increase the number of images that you can add, and allow uploading of your own images.

- Personnel mentioned
  
  - The program by default shows the three persons that were most frequently mentioned in the past few slides.
  
  - However, you can list additional personnel. Just type the names of the persons mentioned, separating each person using a comma.
