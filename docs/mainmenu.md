# The Main Menu

## When starting the program

After starting the Node server, this is the screen you see:

<img src="images\mainmenu.png" title="" alt="" width="640">[Needs to be replaced with version that includes content in the future]

The program shows the slides that you've made front and centre. By selecting one of the slides, you can immediately change slide properties, add the slide to a slideshow, check for license details for any images included in the slide and more.

Using the controls in the top of the user interface, you can search for an slide that you've already made, create a new slide, or change the program's colour scheme.

## Searching for slides

By using the search bar in the top left of the main menu user interface, you can search for a slide. Just type in your query and the program will attempt to find a suitable slide.

## Changing the colour scheme

The program includes two colour schemes, dark (default) and light.

Pressing the moon (or sun) icon changes the colour scheme.

[Should we add a feature that automatically determines the Windows colour scheme and change the default theme automatically, or is this unnecessary?]
