# The Main Menu

## When starting the program

After starting the Node server, this is the screen you see:

<img src="images\mainmenu.png" title="" alt="" width="640">[Needs to be replaced with version that includes content in the future]

The program shows academic engagements front and centre. By selecting one of the engagements, you can immediately view information about the engagement, create a slideshow about the engagement, check for license details for any images included in the engagement and more.

Using the controls in the top of the user interface, you can search for an engagement, change the colour scheme, or add a new slide.

## Searching for engagements

By using the search bar in the top left of the main menu user interface, you can search for an engagement. Just type in your query and the program will attempt to find a suitable engagement. 

If the program cannot find an engagement, then it will suggest alternatives to the engagement that may be relevant.

## Changing the colour scheme

The program includes two colour schemes, dark (default) and light.

Pressing the moon (or sun) icon changes the colour scheme.

[Should we add a feature that automatically determines the Windows colour scheme and change the default theme automatically, or is this unnecessary?]
